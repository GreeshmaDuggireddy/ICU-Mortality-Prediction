# ICU-Mortality-Prediction
A patient survival prediction model leveraging machine learning techniques and data from the first 24 hours of intensive care.

## Abstract
Intensive Care Units in hospitals are one of the most critical places. A patient is moved to the ICU when their health is deteriorating. The urgency and type of therapy are determined by examining the patient. We can respond to threats ahead of time and offer the patient more advanced care if we can estimate a patient’s survival probability using data from multiple metrics collected during the first 24 hours of admission to an intensive care unit. This increases the patient’s chances of survival. As a result, the mortality rate in hospitals will be lower. A critical point to remember in this case, as in many others, is that the data is highly skewed. The goal is to develop a model that predicts patient survival based on data from the first 24 hours of intensive care.
